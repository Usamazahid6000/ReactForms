# ReactForms
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and MUI were used to construct this project. For this project, make a sign-up and sign-in form in React. I'll keep user data in a database called Firebase Store. further stored user data in the browser using local storage. In the event that the user credentials are accurate, we will redirect them to the dashboard page.
